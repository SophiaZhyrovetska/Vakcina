[Vakcina](http://vakcina.pythonanywhere.com) helps with the whole process of vaccination, specifically you can: <br>
* see what vaccines you need to do in the nearest future
* see in which hospitals you can find these vaccines
* be notified when the time for vaccination comes
* be aware of the epidemics near you
* find which vaccines you need to do to travel abroad safely
